The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web \
transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained \
(e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit \
microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained \
networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks \
(6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical \
throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for machine- \
to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building \
automation.\r\n\r\n\
\
CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between \
application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and \
resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and \
Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP \
for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements \
such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for \
constrained environments.\
